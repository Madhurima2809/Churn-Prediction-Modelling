# Identifying & Minimizing Churn of telecom services through analysis of consumer habits

### INTRODUCTION
Subscription products are the main source of revenue for the major telecom industries. The telco industry designs their products either in the form of a 'one size fits all' overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of the structure of the membership, companies always tries to minimize customer churn. To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral pattern that act as catalyst in disengagement with the service.

* Market:
The target audience is the company's subscription base. They are the ones companies want to retain.
* Product:
The subscription services that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users may not have imagined, or they may have forgotten.
* Goal:
The objective of this model is to pedict which users are likely to Churn, so that the company can fpcus on re-engaging these usrs with the product. These efforts can be email reminders abour the benifits of the service, specially focusing on the features that are new or the user has shown interest.

### BUSINESS CHALLENGE

* In this case study we will be working for a telco company that provides services (voice calls, internat plans, international plans) to its users. For telco industries identifying the potential customers who are likely to churn have become a vital issue. Customer churn have become a major barier in the revenue generating mechanism. In this competitive market, customer loyalty depends hugely on the services that the comapny provides. The companies faces an average churn rate of about 10-30%. Nowadays, customer retention have become a primary concern than customer acquisition since it costs a company 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. 
* We are in charge of identifying users who are likely to cancel their subscription so that we can start building new features that they may be interested in. These features can increase their engagement and interest of our users towards the service.
