# Churn-Prediction-Modelling
### Business Problem
Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases. Churn indicates the movement of customers from one company to another. For telco industries identifying the potential customers who are likely to churn have become a vital issue. Customer churn have become a major barier in the revenue generating mechanism. In this competitive market, customer loyalty depends hugely on the services that the comapny provides. The companies faces an average churn rate of about 10-30%. Nowadays, customer retention have become a primary concern than customer acquisition since it costs a company 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. Thus predicting customer churn rate can enable the company to reduce their looses.
In this project, we will be addressing Customer churn problem for a fictitious telecom company. The company has provided the usage pattern for their  customers for over a period of time along with the info whether particular customer  is churned or not.
Utilizing the input data, we have to build a model which can predict the customer going to be churned well in advance. The company then targets those customers with special programs or incentives. This approach can bring in huge loss for a company, if churn predictions are  inaccurate, because then firms are wasting incentive money on customers who would  have stayed anyway
### Data 
The data is provided and can be downloaded from https://github.com/Madhurima2809/Churn-Prediction-Modelling/blob/main.
### Solution
From the above business statement it is clear that this is a Binary Classification from and the target data (Churn) is imbalanced. Here, we are more concerned about the minority class (Churn= True).
##### The solution is developed using Python Jupyter Notebook. It comprises of EDA and fitting of several Classification Models along with evaluation of the models.
